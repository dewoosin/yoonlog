## Qusetion
What are your goals for learning English, and how do you plan to achieve them?

## Answer
My goal in learning English is ==to be able to== handle simple tasks. I once worked part-time at a sushi restaurant when I was in Canada. Back then, I could speak a bit of English, but now I've forgotten a lot and I'm not as good. I remember when a friend from Japan visited Korea, we tried to converse in English for a day, but it was so difficult that I felt really ==frustrated== . Starting today, I plan to study by memorizing and learning one or two sentences every two days or twice a week.


- frustrate : 좌절, 낙담하다.
- to be able to :  ~ 할 수 있다.
